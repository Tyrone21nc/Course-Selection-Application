NOTE: This basic information about courses priority for registration was received from ChatGPT

Most colleges use a priority system, then open remaining seats FCFS. Priority is usually based on:
- Class standing (seniors → juniors → sophomores → freshmen)
- Major/minor requirements
- Honors programs, athletes, or special cohorts
- Credit count or graduation proximity
- Accommodations (e.g., DSS)
After priority windows close, registration often becomes open/FCFS until courses fill. Policies vary by school, 
but seniors registering first is the most common model.
